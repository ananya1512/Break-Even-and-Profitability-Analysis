# Break-Even-and-Profitability-Analysis

# üìÑ Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the break-even point and profitability scenarios for **Velocity Bikes**, a bicycle manufacturing company. Using advanced Excel tools, I evaluated how changes in sales volume, pricing strategies, and production levels impact net income. The goal was to provide actionable insights to support financial planning and strategic decision-making.

# üõ† Methodology

- **Baseline Analysis:** Calculated revenue, expenses, and net income based on projected sales.
- **Goal Seek:** Determined the exact break-even sales volume for the Velocity One bicycle.
- **One-Variable Data Table:** Analyzed how different sales volumes affect net income.
- **Two-Variable Data Table:** Evaluated the combined impact of changes in selling price and units sold.
- **Scenario Manager:** Modeled and compared four different business scenarios for Velocity One:
  - Status Quo
  - Reduced Pricing
  - Reduced Operations
  - Expanded Operations
- **Solver Optimization:** Identified the optimal production mix across multiple bicycle models to maximize profitability within business constraints.

# üìà Key Results

- Selling **3,000 Velocity One bicycles at $1,400** each yields **$4.2M revenue** and **$193,500 net income**.
- The **break-even point** is at approximately **2,570 units sold**.
- Selling **4,500 units** generates a **net income of $868,500**.

## üìä Price Sensitivity
- At a price of **$1,600**, break-even occurs between **1,500‚Äì2,000 units**.
- At a price of **$1,000**, the company does **not break even** even beyond **5,000 units sold**.

## üîç Scenario Analysis (Scenario Manager Results)
- **Status Quo** showed the most favorable balance between revenue and profitability.
- **Reduced Pricing** improved sales volume but significantly reduced profit margins.
- **Reduced Operations** cut costs but also lowered revenue and limited growth.
- **Expanded Operations** increased revenue but raised costs disproportionately.

**Decision:** Continue with **Status Quo** for the next year based on its optimal net income performance.

## üß† Solver Optimization Outcome
Increase profits by **3.51%** by producing and selling:
- **2,809 Velocity One bicycles**
- **3,381 Velocity Two bicycles**
- **2,422 Velocity Three bicycles**
- **3,388 Velocity Racer bicycles**

# ‚úÖ Recommendations

- Maintain the **$1,400 price point** for Velocity One to ensure sustainable profitability.
- Ensure **sales exceed 2,570 units** to avoid operating at a loss.
- Adopt the **Status Quo** strategy for the next business year based on Scenario Manager analysis.
- Avoid **deep discounting** unless backed by strong market demand to maintain healthy margins.
- Adjust **production mix** based on Solver optimization results to further maximize profits across all models.
